I think we can all say that we have run a mile once. One of the requirements to pass gym class is running a mile and it doesn't matter how fast or slow you run. It was all about trying and finishing. I say this because on my first mile of bootcamp, it feels like I am running a mile. Usually how running a mile works is that we do four laps to make a mile. So when I ran my first lap it seemed easy. Then when I get to my second and third lap I start to slow down and every step gets a little bit harder. Then when I get to my last lap and all I want to do is push myself so I can finish strong. All of these feelings felt the same during my first mile of bootcamp. The first few days were easy and mainly review. Then around half way through the week and the first half of the second week, things rapidly slowed down and harder. Then in the last half, all I want to do is push myself so I can finish strong and make through the “First Mile”.
